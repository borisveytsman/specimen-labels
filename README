		   Specimen labels for collections
		R. Sean Thackurdeen and Boris Veytsman

A class to typeset herbarium and other specimen labels using a
spreadsheet of specimen data.

In the field, notes of a plant collection are made on weather
resistant paper. At a moment's rest in the field, or back at home,
data is provisionally transferred to a spreadsheet. The columns of the
spreadsheet usually correspond to the database schema of the archival
repository. Most often the schema adheres to the biodiversity standard
known as Darwin Core (DwC).

This class creates typeset labels ready to be cut and used.
